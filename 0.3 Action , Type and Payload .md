# Redux Actions & Payload - Complete Guide

## 1️⃣ What is an Action in Redux?

An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in the app.
Think of it as a message you send to Redux.

### 🧠 Real-life analogy
📩 Action = "User clicked Add to Cart" Redux itself doesn't do anything — it just receives the message.

### ✅ Basic action example

```javascript
{
  type: "cart/addItem"
}
```

* `type` → tells Redux what happened
* Mandatory field

---

## 2️⃣ What is action.payload?

`payload` is the data needed to perform that action.
If action says what happened, payload says with what data.

### 🧠 Real-life analogy
🧾 Action: "Add item to cart" 📦 Payload: `{ id: 101, name: "Laptop", price: 50000 }`

### ✅ Action with payload

```javascript
{
  type: "cart/addItem",
  payload: {
    id: 101,
    name: "Laptop",
    price: 50000
  }
}
```

## 3️⃣ Action vs Payload (CLEAR difference)

| Part      | Meaning                     |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `type`    | What happened               |
| `payload` | Data needed to update state |

## 4️⃣ How actions are USED (important flow)

### 🔁 Redux data flow

```
UI → dispatch(action) → reducer → state updates
```

---

## 5️⃣ Practical example (Redux Toolkit)

### 🟢 Slice

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: "cart",
  initialState: { items: [] },
  reducers: {
    addItem(state, action) {
      state.items.push(action.payload);
    },
  },
});
```

### 🧠 What is happening here?
* `action` is passed automatically
* `action.payload` contains the data sent from UI

### 🟢 Dispatching the action

```javascript
dispatch(addItem({ id: 1, name: "Phone" }));
```

Redux internally creates this action:

```javascript
{
  type: "cart/addItem",
  payload: { id: 1, name: "Phone" }
}
```

---

## 7️⃣ Can actions exist WITHOUT payload?

### ✅ YES

```javascript
dispatch(logout());
```

```javascript
{
  type: "auth/logout"
}
```

No payload needed — just an event.

---

## 8️⃣ Multiple payload examples (real life)

### Increment counter

```javascript
dispatch(increment(5));
```

```javascript
payload: 5
```

### Delete item

```javascript
dispatch(deleteItem(id));
```

```javascript
payload: id
```

### Update user

```javascript
dispatch(updateUser({ name: "Priyansh", age: 22 }));
```

```javascript
payload: { name, age }
```
