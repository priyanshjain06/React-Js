# 📚 Redux Notes

A powerful alternative to prop drilling, making state management a breeze!

**Centralized Store**: Your single source of truth for application state.

## 🔑 Key Terms

### Action {event/object}
Represents an event or an event with additional info.

Example: Includes payload, object, or data.

### Store {hold states}
The heart of Redux, containing:
- **State**: The data you want to manipulate.
- **Reducers**: Functions to update the state.

### Reducer {functions}

### Slice {features}
Manages state logic for individual features.

### State {data}

## 🚀 Workflow

From user interaction to UI update, Redux streamlines the process!

### Path:
```
UI trigger → Action dispatch → Store → Reducer → State update in store → UI update
```

### Example:
```
Button click → handlefunc() → Store → increment() → num+1 in store → num+1 in UI
```

1. **Create Store** (Place it in the redux folder)
2. **Wrap App.js with Provider** to connect Redux to your app
3. **Create Slice** (Store in the features folder)
4. **Create Reducers** in the slice
5. **Register Reducers** in the store

## 🧰 Useful Hooks

**useSelector**: Access state from the store.

**dispatch**: Send actions to the store.
